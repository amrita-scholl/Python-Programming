## 1)  Sets in Python come with several built-in methods that allow you to perform various operations. 
      ### Set Methods
      
      1) add(elem):  Adds an element elem to the set. If elem is already present, it does nothing.
      2) clear(): Removes all elements from the set.
      3) copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the set.
      4) difference(sets): Returns a set that contains elements in the original set but not in the specified sets.
      5) difference_update(sets): Removes elements found in the specified sets from the original set.
      6) discard(elem): Removes elem from the set if it is present. Does nothing if elem is not present.
      7) intersection(sets): Returns a set that contains elements common to all specified sets.
      8) intersection_update(sets): Updates the original set to keep only elements found in all specified sets.
      9) isdisjoint(set): Returns True if the set has no elements in common with the specified set.
      10) issubset(set): Returns True if the set is a subset of the specified set.
      11) issuperset(set): Returns True if the set is a superset of the specified set.
      12) pop(): Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises a KeyError if the set is empty.
      13) remove(elem): Removes elem from the set. Raises a KeyError if elem is not present.
      14) symmetric_difference(set): Returns a set with elements in either set but not in both.
      15) symmetric_difference_update(set): Updates the original set to contain elements in either set but not in both.
      16) union(sets): Returns a set that contains all elements from the original set and all specified sets.
      17) update(sets): Updates the original set with elements from all specified sets.
